## for the rmd 

open ants_multimodality.Rmd in Rstudio, then knit the pdf

you will have some missing files - these are due to the hardcoded paths.

the variable to change is `bd=...`

## for the beamer

to compile the presentation

0. run all the examples to make sure they work (optional)  --- you need to have ANTS binaries in your path for this work.
   
   examples should be run from within the examples directory

1.  go into the examples directory and type

prepare_inputs_to_presentation

which creates the tex input from the examples

2. use cmake to generate the presentation pdf 

mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ../ ; make ; cp ./tex/ants_multimodality.pdf ../

# to add a new example , create the newexample_example.sh file in the examples dir, 
# then go to CMakeLists.txt and add the tex filename under add_latex_document
